# STEP 1. Install and use renv ----
# **[OPTIONAL] Initialization: Install and use renv ----
# The R Environment ("renv") package helps you create reproducible environments
# for your R projects. This is helpful when working in teams because it makes
# your R projects more isolated, portable and reproducible.

# Further reading:
#   Summary: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/
#   More detailed article: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

# "renv" It can be installed as follows:
# if (!is.element("renv", installed.packages()[, 1])) {
#   install.packages("renv", dependencies = TRUE) # nolint
# }
# require("renv") # nolint

# Once installed, you can then use renv::init() to initialize renv in a new
# project.

# The prompt received after executing renv::init() is as shown below:
# This project already has a lockfile. What would you like to do?

# 1: Restore the project from the lockfile.
# 2: Discard the lockfile and re-initialize the project.
# 3: Activate the project without snapshotting or installing any packages.
# 4: Abort project initialization.

# Select option 1 to restore the project from the lockfile
# renv::init() # nolint

# This will set up a project library, containing all the packages you are
# currently using. The packages (and all the metadata needed to reinstall
# them) are recorded into a lockfile, renv.lock, and a .Rprofile ensures that
# the library is used every time you open the project.

# Consider a library as the location where packages are stored.
# Execute the following command to list all the libraries available in your
# computer:
.libPaths()

# One of the libraries should be a folder inside the project if you are using
# renv

# Then execute the following command to see which packages are available in
# each library:
lapply(.libPaths(), list.files)

# This can also be configured using the RStudio GUI when you click the project
# file, e.g., "BBT4206-R.Rproj" in the case of this project. Then
# navigate to the "Environments" tab and select "Use renv with this project".

# As you continue to work on your project, you can install and upgrade
# packages, using either:
# install.packages() and update.packages or
# renv::install() and renv::update()

# You can also clean up a project by removing unused packages using the
# following command: renv::clean()

# After you have confirmed that your code works as expected, use
# renv::snapshot(), AT THE END, to record the packages and their
# sources in the lockfile.

# Later, if you need to share your code with someone else or run your code on
# a new machine, your collaborator (or you) can call renv::restore() to
# reinstall the specific package versions recorded in the lockfile.

# [OPTIONAL]
# Execute the following code to reinstall the specific package versions
# recorded in the lockfile (restart R after executing the command):
# renv::restore() # nolint

# [OPTIONAL]
# If you get several errors setting up renv and you prefer not to use it, then
# you can deactivate it using the following command (restart R after executing
# the command):
# renv::deactivate() # nolint

# If renv::restore() did not install the "languageserver" package (required to
# use R for VS Code), then it can be installed manually as follows (restart R
# after executing the command):
if (!is.element("languageserver", installed.packages()[, 1])) {
  install.packages("languageserver", dependencies = TRUE)
}
require("languageserver")

# Methods used for sentiment analysis include:

# Summary of each variable
summary(student_performance_dataset)

# STEP 4. Create a subset of the data using the "dplyr" package ----
## The "dplyr" Package ----
# We will also require the "dplyr" package

# "dplyr" is a grammar of *data manipulation*, providing a consistent set of
# verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:
#   mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
#   select() picks variables based on their names.
#   group_by() groups the data into categories
#   filter() picks cases based on their values.
#   summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
#   arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.

# Documentation of "dplyr":
#   https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr or
#   https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr

## The Pipe Operator in the "dplyr" Package ----
# In R, the %>% symbol represents the pipe operator.
# The pipe operator is used for chaining or piping operations together in a
# way that enhances the readability and maintainability of code. It is
# useful when working with data manipulation and data transformation tasks.

# The %>% operator takes the result of the expression on its left and passes it
# as the first argument to the function on its right. This allows you to chain
# together a sequence of operations on a dataset or object.

# For example:
# Example 1:
# library(dplyr) # Load the dplyr package (which uses %>%) # nolint

# result <- df %>%
#   filter(age > 30) %>%   # Filter rows where age is greater than 30
#   group_by(gender) %>%  # Group the data by gender
#   summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary))  # Calculate the mean salary for each group # nolint

# # 'result' now contains the result of these operations

# Example 2:
# nhanes_dataset <- nhanes_dataset %>%
#   mutate(MAP = BPDiaAve + (1 / 3) * (BPSysAve - BPDiaAve)) # nolint

evaluation_per_group_per_gender <- student_performance_dataset %>% # nolint

           ifelse(gender == 1, "Male", "Female")) %>%

# STEP 5. Data Cleansing for Qualitative Data ----
## Contractions ----

# Contractions in the English language are shortened forms of words or phrases
# created by combining two words and replacing one or more letters with an
# apostrophe ('), often for the purpose of making speech or writing more
# concise and informal. Contractions are often used in informal speech and
# writing but are generally avoided in formal writing, such as academic papers
# or business reports.

## Stemming ----
# Stemming is a text processing technique used to reduce words to their base or
# root form, known as the "stem."
# The goal of stemming is to simplify words to their common linguistic root,
# which can help improve text analysis and Information Retrieval by treating
# different inflections or variations of a word as the same word.

# Stemming groups together words with the same meaning but different
# grammatical forms. For example, stemming can convert words like "jumping,"
# "jumps," and "jumped" to the common stem "jump."

# Stemming is a simple and heuristic-based approach and may not always produce
# accurate results. In some cases, it may produce stems that are not actual
# words or may result in ambiguity. For this reason, more advanced techniques
# like *lemmatization*, which considers the context and grammatical structure
# of words, are often preferred for certain Natural Language Processing (NLP)
# tasks.

## Text Mining ----
# The goal of text mining is to discover relevant information that is possibly
# unknown or hidden. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one methodology used
# in mining text. It attempts to decipher the ambiguities in written language
# by:
#   (i) tokenization
#   (ii) clustering
#   (iii) extracting entity and word relationships
#   (iv) using algorithms to identify themes and quantify subjective
#        information.

## Tokenization ----
# Tokenization is the process of breaking out text into smaller meaningful
# units called tokens.

# Tokenization is often one of the initial steps in text preprocessing, which
# prepares text data for analysis. Other preprocessing steps may include
# removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization.

# Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP because it allows text data to be
# represented in a format that can be used for further analysis and machine
# learning tasks. It forms the basis for many text processing techniques and is
# essential for understanding and working with textual data in computational
# applications.

## Stopword Removal ----

# A stopword is a commonly used word that is usually filtered out during text
# mining to improve the efficiency and focus of text analysis.
# Stopwords are words that are considered to be of little value in many text
# analysis tasks because they are frequently used in the language and do not
# carry significant meaning on their own.
# Examples of stopwords in English include:
# "the," "and," "is," "in," "it," "of," "to," "for," and "with."

# Additional examples can be seen here:
head(sample(stop_words$word, 20), 20)

# You can create a list of words that you would like to filter out
undesirable_words <- c("wow", "lol", "none", "na")

# unnest and remove stop, undesirable and short words
evaluation_likes_filtered <- evaluation_likes_and_wishes %>% # nolint
  unnest_tokens(word, Likes) %>%
  # do not join where the word is in the list of stopwords
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(!word %in% undesirable_words) %>%
  filter(nchar(word) > 3) %>%
  rename(`Likes (tokenized)` = word) %>%
  select(-Wishes)

evaluation_wishes_filtered <- evaluation_likes_and_wishes %>% # nolint
  unnest_tokens(word, Wishes) %>%

# STEP 8. Word Cloud ----

# Word clouds are visually appealing and can provide a quick, intuitive
# representation of the most frequently occurring words in a text or dataset.

# [CAUTION] However, they also have several disadvantages:
#   1. Lack of context
#   2. Loss of quantitative information
#   3. Insensitive to word importance
#   4. Difficulty in handling large datasets
#   5. Ineffective for sentiment analysis
#   6. Ambiguity
#   7. Limited customization
#   8. Subjectivity
#   9. Difficulty in multilingual texts
#   10. Statistical limitations

## Evaluation Likes ----

# STEP 9. Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) ----
# We need to quantify just how important various terms are in each comment with
# respect to all the comments made.

# TF-IDF is used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to
# a collection of documents (corpus).
# By doing so, TF-IDF helps identify how significant a word is within a
# particular document compared to its general frequency in a set of documents.

# The assumption behind TF-IDF is that terms that appear more frequently in a
# document (or a comment) should be given a higher weight, unless it also
# appears in many documents (or many other comments).

## Term Frequency (TF) ----
# This measures how often a word appears in a specific document. Words that
# occur frequently within a document are likely to be important in describing
# the content of that document.

### Formula for TF ----
# (Number of times a term appears in a document) /
#   (Total number of terms in the document)

## Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) ----
# This measures how unique or rare a word is across a collection of documents.
# Words that are rare across many documents but present in one specific
# document are considered more valuable in distinguishing that document from
# others.

### Formula for IDF ----
# log((Total number of documents in the corpus) /
#   (Number of documents containing the term))

## TF-IDF Score ----
# The TF-IDF score combines both TF and IDF. It assigns a higher score to words
# that have high frequency within a document (TF) but are relatively rare in
# other documents (IDF). These are the words that are considered most important
# for describing the content of a particular document.

### Formula for TF-IDF ----
# The formula is: TF * IDF
# In essence, TF-IDF helps identify words that are both frequent within a
# document and distinctive across a corpus. These words are often considered to
# be the keywords or key terms that best represent the content or topic of the
# document.

## Example of TF-IDF ----
# Consider a collection of news articles. The word "election" might appear
# frequently in many articles, but if it appears significantly more often in
# one specific article, the TF-IDF score for "election" in that article would
# be high, indicating that "election" is an important term in that specific
# article.

# TF-IDF is widely used in various NLP applications, such as text
# classification, information retrieval, document clustering, and more, to help
# analyze and understand textual data by identifying the most relevant and
# distinctive terms within documents.

## Summary ----
# Term Frequency (TF): Number of times a term occurs in a document
# Document Frequency (DF): Number of documents that contain each word
# Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) = 1/DF
# TF-IDF is equal to TF * IDF
# The IDF of any term is therefore a higher number for words that occur in
# fewer of the documents in the collection.

# **Required Lab Work Submission** ----

# NOTE: The lab work should be done in groups of between 2 and 5 members using
#       Git and GitHub.

## Part A ----
# Create a new file in the project's root folder called
# "Lab2-Submission-ExploratoryDataAnalysis.R".
# Use this file to provide all the code you have used to perform an exploratory
# data analysis of the "Class Performance Dataset" provided on the eLearning
# platform.

## Part B ----
# Upload *the link* to your "Lab2-Submission-ExploratoryDataAnalysis.R" hosted
# on Github (do not upload the .R file itself) through the submission link
# provided on eLearning.

## Part C ----
# Create a markdown file called "Lab-Submission-Markdown.Rmd"
# and place it inside the folder called "markdown". Use R Studio to ensure the
# .Rmd file is based on the "GitHub Document (Markdown)" template when it is
# being created.

# Refer to the following file in Lab 1 for an example of a .Rmd file based on
# the "GitHub Document (Markdown)" template:
#     https://github.com/course-files/BBT4206-R-Lab1of15-LoadingDatasets/blob/main/markdown/BIProject-Template.Rmd # nolint

# Include Line 1 to 14 of BIProject-Template.Rmd in your .Rmd file to make it
# displayable on GitHub when rendered into its .md version

# It should have code chunks that explain only *the most significant*
# analysis performed on the dataset.

# The emphasis should be on Explanatory Data Analysis (explains the key
# statistics performed on the dataset) as opposed to
# Exploratory Data Analysis (presents ALL the statistics performed on the
# dataset). Exploratory Data Analysis that presents ALL the possible statistics
# re-creates the problem of information overload.

## Part D ----
# Render the .Rmd (R markdown) file into its .md (markdown) version by using
# knitR in RStudio.

# You need to download and install "pandoc" to render the R markdown.
# Pandoc is a file converter that can be used to convert the following files:
#   https://pandoc.org/diagram.svgz?v=20230831075849

# Documentation:
#   https://pandoc.org/installing.html and
#   https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/R-Markdown

# By default, Rmd files are open as Markdown documents. To enable R Markdown
# features, you need to associate *.Rmd files with rmd language.
# Add an entry Item "*.Rmd" and Value "rmd" in the VS Code settings editor.

# Documentation of knitR: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/

# Upload *the link* to "Lab-Submission-Markdown.md" (not .Rmd)
# markdown file hosted on Github (do not upload the .Rmd or .md markdown files)
# through the submission link provided on eLearning.
